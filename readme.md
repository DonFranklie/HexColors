# HexColors Project

This project is a simple web page that allows users to generate random hex colors by clicking on a button. The page displays a randomly generated hex color code, and the background color of the page changes accordingly.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Click the "Click Here" button to generate a random hex color.

## How it Works

When the "Click Here" button is clicked, the `changeColor()` function is triggered. This function generates a random hex color code by picking six random characters from the `hexValues` array. The chosen hex color code is then displayed below the button, and the background color of the page changes to the generated color.

The hex color code is displayed in the following format:

```
#HEXCODE
```

## Styling

The project is styled using CSS to create an appealing and interactive design. The button changes its appearance on hover, and the project title has a color-changing animation.

## Compatibility

This project is designed to work on modern web browsers and devices. The responsive design ensures that it functions well on various screen sizes.
